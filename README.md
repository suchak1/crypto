**Data Collection** in the function coinUpdate()
- [x] Collects, manipulates, and displays cryptocurrency price data in realtime (live) from exchange APIs for specific analytic use.

**Graphical Visualization** in the function dailyAvg()
- [x] Measures and records rates of return for cryptocurrency and traditional stock market investments daily for automatic data visualization in the form of historical line graphs in linear and log scales.

**Predictive Modelling** in the function wolframSET() and wolframGET()
- [x] Passes collected historical data
